# Usage

Each style has unique options to edit the appearance of the card.

Bordermode sets the type of border from multiple options. Magic Set Editor does not support transparency in exporting cards, so Blank cannot make transparent cards.

Flavor size sets the size of the flavor box, and adds a bar to seperate flavor and rules text. Input only numbers here, it may take a little bit of fiddling to get working properly.

Inverted info inverts the crediting text boxes, for when art is dark/bright to ensure readability.

Custom Bars 1-4 are there to add rules text bars. Input only numbers here.

The icon replacement setup is designed around easily accessing important icons. You can also add icons by using the menu Format>Insert Symbol. All icon replacements work on [Icon]: (Example: tap is T:)

If the card size is too big to function, you can edit zoom level in Edit>Preferences>Display>Zoom.
